__label__0 "the sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area . i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately . it truly is a great tank top !"
__label__0 "not for the curvy women . fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt . the snowflake and stripe design is really cute and the fabric is of nice quality . it 's a very loose fit which i would 've been willing to work with but ... as mentioned in previous reviews the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long . it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms . not attrac"
__label__0 "i like the style and the design of this culottes but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface . i had a few loose loops for just one wear ... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping but not good to go to the park or play with kids ..."
__label__1 "beautiful shirt . the color is more navy than pictured . the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture . my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem ."
__label__1 "this robe is warm soft and i like how long it is ! it 's perfect length . my favorite thing to wear around the house !"
__label__1 "love cloth and stone . this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured . soft and casual with great design details ."
__label__1 "overall i really like this dress . the color is vibrant & unique . the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i 'm getting it tailored ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch ! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath !"
__label__0 "these pants are so adorable and fit perfectly ( long enough even on my 5'10 frame ) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through even with nude panties . you can still clearly see them . so disappointed ."
__label__-1 "again bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses . i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess mid-vacation on the amalfi coast . i tried it on at home and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top . since i 'm not with child this one 's going back !"
__label__0 "the material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well . when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there 's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out . it made me look much bigger than i am . i ordered a large ( normally i wear lg or xl ) and it 's possible a medium would have fit better . unfortunately this shirt had to be returned ."
__label__1 "perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort . the high waist does n't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over . perfect to go with crop tops"
__label__-1 "after reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it i loved the fabric and color however it was so ill-fitting . it 's like the designer did n't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top -- too wide . i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly . it is too wide and not long enough . both are going back !"
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 2 and 105 lbs ; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large . i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist ! did n't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style . sadly had to return my purchase ."
__label__-1 "description is wrong . not a swing tunic . more long and straight . keep that in mind when buying this . if you have hips this might not be the top for you"
__label__0 "while this top is pretty it 's very unflattering . it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier . too bad because i really wanted to like it ."
__label__-1 "i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer . picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day . i feel as if i wasted my money ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love this especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top . when the top arrived the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace did n't completely cover my black strapless bra ( and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest ) . thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable . i did love the length of the top though . wish this top was a keeper but going to have to return ."
__label__1 "i bought this in black last year and i love it . i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops are n't really my style and these prints would n't be so easy to mix and match . please offer in other solid colors ! i would buy all of them this skirt is really that fabulous . not only does it fit well and run true to size it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on and gives a little more tummy coverage . but not too much ! somehow it hits me a"
__label__0 "these pants are lovely and comfortable but they are entirely too delicate . i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them they snagged . i was worried about it when i saw the fabric and thought i 'd give it a try but i did n't think it would be this bad . for the price i expect better quality . also they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher closer to the natural waist . i 'm usually a 4/6 28/29 in b"
__label__0 "picked this up in the store today but did n't try it on first . it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on . there is wonderful detailing but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on . i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length . the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame . such a shame -- -really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l"
__label__0 "i desperately wanted this to work - it 's a beautiful color and overall quality ... it is just so short and wide ( almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat ) . i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side but on my 5 ' 7 frame and long torso it just did n't look right . few extra inches and this could have been awesome !"
__label__0 "i love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color . my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband . not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants . retailer -- please color test your garments . there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age !"

__label__1 "this dress is really pretty but not made for girls with hips . i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 ( typical of shifts i guess but a girls can dream ! ) . if you are a straighter shape though i would highly recommend ."
__label__-1 "i could n't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd . the arms cut off short and the seams do n't hit your shoulders where they should . all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering . moving around in it was not easy . i will return this one !"
__label__0 "dress cut was great but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this . however the fit was funky and the colors were muted . this is definitely something you must try on in the store . too risky to buy online due to weird fit ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this dress bit it was n't to be . strange fit and does n't drape nicely as in the photo . also the blue color was much darker in person . would n't recommend ."
__label__-1 "just not as long as in the picture . it hit me at my hips not good !"
__label__-1 "this top is beautifully made and designed . material is soft and comfortable however it 's very boxy . the details on the side stick out . i just found it not very flattering for me ."
__label__0 "if you can get over the fact that this skirt feels ( and looks awfully similar to ) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid ... then it 's surprisingly fun to wear ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed that this dress had no pockets as every picture on this website suggests . otherwise it is a great color and shape . still sad though ..."
__label__1 "beautiful top ! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid . it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out . my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight . i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in black and white thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles . i returned the black because it looked like polyester . the white is actually a cream/ivory not bright white as pictured . it is also not the best feeling quality however the fit is good and true to size ."
__label__0 "i 'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews . when it went on sale i thought i 'd try but it was like a tent on me . the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo . too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo ."
__label__1 "i 'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly ! i love the taupe color - it 's feminine ( not overtly so ) and i can still use it as a neutral . the quality is really quite good though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories ( without smooth edges ) away from the fabric . it 's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu . i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia"
__label__1 "i love this top and bought it in both colors . what 's really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you . these tops are designed to have a flattering fit . i ordered size small and they are not too tight . i am 36 c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom . i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck which is flattering on me . the material is soft and of good"
__label__-1 "way too much fabric ; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek ! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself ... the outer layer also does n't feel like it will breath . add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer . returning ."
__label__0 "this dress is really beautiful . very well made and high quality fabrics . unfortunately it is cut very narrow . i am between sizes ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small . i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge . if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you ."
__label__-1 "dress is much different in person . thin ribbed cotton . a little tight for xl . it looks like a throw back dress from contempos . returned and would not recommend"
__label__1 "this precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain . the circles are a bronze color and can not be felt through the skirt net . it 's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office . i received many compliments on my first wearing ."
__label__1 "this gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes . the silk is light airy and very delicate . the bodice runs large and the length runs long ( i have to wear my highest platforms ) but i would not return because it 's an exquisite piece of art ."
__label__0 "the dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant . maybe this style is n't for me and i even sized down . otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy . it did n't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress ."
__label__1 "i thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear . i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design . but the sleeves were a bit short on me . and i thought it was a little pricy . i decided against it for those reasons . but if you do n't mind those things then you might like it . it 's definitely worth the try ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy ! with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open . i am a regular b cup and i don ; t think it was sizing ( though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes ) . the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear . unfortunate because the design is so pretty ."
__label__1 "the fabric quality and style are amazing . the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult . i generally do n't wear shorts because of length style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler . i usually wear a 24/00 in pants i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly . one of my favorite purchases ever ! ! !"
__label__1 "i ordered the red motif in size xl . for me the fit matches the model so i think it 's true-to-size . the only larger area on me is for the armholes . i use a cami so my bra wo n't show when raising my arms . since it 's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length it 's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape . but overall it 's so soft and comfortable . the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful . prettier in person . there 's no problem with pattern placement either . a great top for summ"
__label__0 "this dress is most definitely not a maxi ! barely goes below the knees . also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice . there are no folds which were an added plus on picture . waist is higher not at natural waist . very pretty silk though and still cute . just not as pictured ."
__label__1 "in my opinion the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase . adorable cut and style comfortable and cute . it 's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans . love this !"
__label__-1 "these look nothing like the picture ! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture . i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90 's that just fit terribly . i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it . the color was also much lighter than shown in picture . super unflattering & just not for me . they 're going back ..."
__label__1 "i 'm glad i tried this on . i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print but i was n't so sure about the cut or style of the top . once it was on however i loved it . i do n't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear . they 're cute on rail-thin young girls but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s . this top is the exception . the details from the buttons to the thin pleats the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering . i wore"
__label__-1 "bought a large could barely pull up over my butt . runs extremely small . it 's cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you ."

__label__-1 "like other reviewers i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it ! well i am very disappointed . the colors are n't as rich as the outdoor photo although they 're brighter than shown in the studio photos . this is just not a flattering dress . i 've put it on three times and taken it back off . the neck is too high the sleeves are too narrow ( and i have really skinny arms ) and there 's no swing to it . i am 5 ' 4 and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small which is what"

__label__-1 "based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering . i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it would n't work . i ca n't imagine this would flatter very many people . the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive . very disappointed -- this will be going back for sure ."
__label__0 "i bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic but it was really huge on me . i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large . it was very long as well and i am 6 ' tall . i am normally a size 8 to give you an idea . i would recommend it but it is going back for me ."
__label__-1 "per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium . it was still tight around the girls ( and i 'm not that well endowed ) but too big in the armholes . the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material . i kept it ( because i 'm lazy ) but not sure how much i 'll wear it given the strange fit ."
__label__-1 "these shorts just did n't work for me . i loved the embroidery and the color but i just do n't have the curves for them . try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure ."
__label__1 "these tights are exactly what i was looking for ! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house . they are a nice weight and durable construction . i plan to pair them with skirts tunics and dresses . they are super cute with ankle boots ."
__label__0 "sheer and lightweight . perfect for summer . great detail could not justify paying full price ."
__label__-1 "i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right ? boy was i wrong . this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that 's incredibly boxy and unattractive . the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on . i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium . it was swimming on me . the stripes are n't as cute in real life"
__label__-1 "extremely disappointed with this top . it runs extremely large . i 'm 5 ' 2 130 lbs 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer . i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me . the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all . fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft . unfortunately i will be returning ."
__label__-1 "purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail -- ( i do n't know why most designers overlook the back ? ? ) . huge disappointment -- the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back is n't even the same material as the front . it 's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment . it was a very sad return ! i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess ."

__label__1 "love this dress so so much ! the wearability of it is n't much since it 's such a wow ! dress but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for itso perfect . if it were a touch shorter i 'd be happy wearing it to the park . i 'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it 's so stunning long . the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying look how cool this is ! ) ."
__label__1 "i thought this shirt was really interesting online and it does n't disappoint in person . i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher . overall though this was a great find and i know i 'll wear it again and again ."
__label__0 "i really want to like this dress - it 's beautiful but it just fits like a sack . the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier . perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode or small chested it would be great ! the quality and color is beautiful ."
__label__1 "fabulous dress ! clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back ( you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer ) ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase . then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money ! look at the top the stripe colors are different . and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well . and the dress was short on me and i 'm two inches shorter than the model . bummer ."

__label__1 "saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint . i ordered a xxs in black and it was perfect . i am 5 ' 3 and 110 lbs . it definitely has a lot of volume to it but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer so you can see through it to your thinner figure underneath . it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it which makes it flattering . another reviewer mentioned the beading turning . i have not seen that on mine but now i will be looking for i"

__label__-1 "i was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up . the waist does not have elastic or any structure . the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open . the fabric is nice quality but i am returning ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it . when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger . when i got them i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect ! beautiful pattern and material . light and airy . sexy with the low-cut keyhole . i am sooo happy with my purchase ."
__label__1 "i 'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs . but this one was perfect . it did n't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips . it 's very flattering ."
__label__1 "so this shirt is very cute i like the drape ( if you can get it arranged properly ) but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy . i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet . i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different . i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine . a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__1 "i just discovered this dress a few days ago and it 's simply dreamy ! ! i 'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops . this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june ! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest . the lace cut-outs are gorgeous !"
__label__0 "i ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton . 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets . 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos . when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out . after examining the detailing i found where the beads were missing . size : i normally wear a small for most retailer brands but i know nothing about slone rouge . i went with a small since it appears oversized on"

__label__1 "very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments . they do fall open when you sit down though they have liner shorts inside for coverage . they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite ."
__label__-1 "the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red . the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me . the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return ."
__label__0 "this dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on . it is on the large size but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look . longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5 ' 9 . i am sending it back . it is a pretty fabric although shinier than expected . i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it ."
__label__-1 "i agree with all of the reviews . the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on. ! the buttons are a nightmare ! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off . ridiculous ! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it . so so so disappointing"

__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such . this really does have a lot going on . i usually wear a 4 in skirts and based on reviews went up one size . it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small ! it 's sooooo tiny at the waist . probably buy 2 sizes 2 and 3 sizes up from your own . also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it does n't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand . it 's like a skirt"
__label__0 "i saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute . tried it on and was delighted . the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look . the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice . i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly . i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top . i bought the top and did n't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only ! yikes . i hate that . this is a casual top to me ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is beautiful but fits much too small . the stitching limits the space in your shoulders and the hem too short . a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10 medium and the shirt did n't work in every direction ."
__label__0 "super cute skirt . i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it ."
__label__1 "love this top ! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work . it can be dressed up or down so it 's very versatile . the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer . received lots of compliments !"
__label__-1 "the fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made . unfortunately the fit was enormous . i 've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops ."
__label__0 "i expected to love this since i usually look good in this style of jacket . it 's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine but i really do n't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just meh . it 's going back unfortunately ."

__label__1 "i tried this tunic at a store and loved it . i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow . the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt . i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size ."
__label__-1 "whatever happened to sizing ! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops . it is also unlined which is not a huge issue . i wore it with a cami . the arms were n't too gaping for me thankfully . i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides . i am 140 lbs and got the small . should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller ."
__label__-1 "at 5 ' 4 i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off ! the colors are so pretty for summer but there is just too much fabric ... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily ! however there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this !"
__label__-1 "after reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs . lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear . all would have been ok if the top was n't so darn short . for reference i 'm 6 ft tall 160 lb . it 's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what"

__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment . there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer . also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way . the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws . i am 5 ' 6 140lb and the small fit tts . will be sending it back"
__label__1 "love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days . i love the squishy soft feel of the material . it works well with sweaters . love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet . i love how simple and practical this coat is . the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head ."
__label__1 "being six feet tall i 'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women and i 'm glad i did on this one ! with the off the shoulder look you can sometimes gain extra length and it 's true in this case . i stayed tts because of length issues and while it is billowy it 's not horribly so . i would think however if you 're between sizes or not worried about height i 'd go with the smaller option . adorable comfy casual while being dressy enough for a night out !"
__label__-1 "i am petite ( 5 ' ) . even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me . i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap . i wanted this to be the perfect lbd i just could n't make it work on my body ."

__label__0 "i ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model . this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out . it is a whole lot of skirt ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up . i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me . it would work on someone taller ."
__label__1 "beautiful top ... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school . it 's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it 's beautiful . definitely worth getting !"
__label__1 "these jeans are great . the rise is perfect ."
__label__0 "i loved the design of the top ! it looks great in person too . i am typically a size 12 top and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on and once on it was super tight around my armpit area and waist . i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit . the fabric has no give or stretch ; it is tight fitting . underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style ."

__label__-1 "this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing . i love the overall design and colors . however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy ! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be . in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large - almost too oversized . the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big . it 's too bad i really loved the look but i 'm not the type to layer . if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would !"
__label__1 "i bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans khaki shorts and camo pedal pushers . added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top . i 'm loving that it shows off my shoulders ( they 're tan from my vacation and i 've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym ) . it 's well made too !"
__label__-1 "if you have anything larger than an a cup this shirt will likely not fit right . it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest . it literally runs right through the center of the breasts . what were they thinking ? if it had been three inches higher or lower it would have been perfect . for reference i 'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup ."
__label__0 "i have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving . the fit for me however is totally wrong . for reference i 'm 32dd 5 ' 8 140 lbs and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms . the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy . the quality felt like it was lacking too . the material felt like it would pill easily . order with caution ."
__label__0 "this dress is n't as fitted as it looks on the model . it appear to be more of a shift dress . as gorgeous as the print and quality are it does n't look great on me . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 105lbs and bought xs . for whatever reason the high neckline is n't flattering on me . i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders ."
__label__1 "the color is a very dark mustard yellow thin/light-weight material and it has a pretty feminine drape . 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt . cute cuffs ( complementary design ) . the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips . all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in . i 'm usually between a s/m i recommend the size up for hip fit ."
__label__-1 "so i 'm not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me . the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium ( i 'm a size 8 bottom ) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose . i just think this one is going to take the right body type . it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me ."

__label__0 "it seems like most people love this tee so you might as well . i returned it because i did n't like how the front hung . if the front was as long as the back i would have kept it . or if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants untucked i might have kept it ( seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts ) . i do like the material though . it 's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area . and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it"

__label__0 "ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust . i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl . i 'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding . this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type ."
__label__-1 "i was thoroughly underwhelmed . it did not hang well and the fit seemed off . the tie waist just sort of hung there . i could have sized down but i did n't even want to bother . it was pretty boring and flimsy for $ 138 ."

__label__0 "the lower part of dress bunches where buttons are so the dress does n't look flushed from top to bottom . i ended up returning it ."
__label__-1 "too wide ! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape . you ca n't see your figure underneath at all . i do n't like pieces like that . this went back ."
__label__1 "was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it 's adorable ! it does run large . i am 5 ' 6 125lb and the 2 fits perfectly . it is super comfortable . i am taking away a star only because it does n't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out ?"
__label__1 "i am so in love with this dress . i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed . i am 5 ' 6 about 145lbs 34d and the 4 fit perfectly ! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it ! !"
__label__1 "and runs large . i 'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big . i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i 'm seeing online ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this shirt . the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful . luxurious soft and flowing . but the collar was frayed ... in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship . i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it . but i ca n't overlook the fact i 'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn . it may be only this"
__label__0 "this sweater is beautiful especially in the bordeaux color . the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies . my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves . there really are no sleeves just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection or pushing the sleeves way up which then results in"
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it 's a much lovelier color in person but that 's about it for me . thoughts below : _____________ pros : - tts . i ordered the medium for my 36c 5 ' 9 frame and found it sufficient . - the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned . it 's a richer brown . think mocha latte in terms of color . - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
__label__1 "got these in my usual size and they are wonderful ! the gray goes with everything i 'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too !"
__label__0 "not what i expected . they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price . returned ."
__label__0 "like the color and romper style . this runs extremely large . i am normally a petite small and it was too large . with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece ."
__label__-1 "well the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time . i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons . fits like tent long huge make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target ."
__label__0 "i really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy . i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same boxy but shorter so i decided to pass ."
__label__0 "i love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes ( 32dd 5 ' 3 curvy ) . i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it 's so cute . i could n't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso . such a bummer !"

__label__-1 "i love the color of this top but the style is not flattering . i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive ! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide . bummer"
__label__0 "i ordered this in blue and loved the color . i 'm not typically into the flowing top style but i tried a few items on my last order this being one . it 's unseamed at the bottom which was my primary reason for returning it - i could n't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style this item is good quality soft comfortable material and a great spring or fall blue ."
__label__1 "i love this skirt . i usually do n't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy . but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing and yet it has structure . the colors are great and go with many top options . i wear it to work and casual outings . it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now ."
__label__1 "i have thicker thighs and do n't usually find that i can wear this kind of thing . these on the other hand are hot hot hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs . i just adore them . i 'm waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too !"
__label__-1 "i 'm so disappointed this dress did n't work out ! i ordered the size medium post baby i 'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer . the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up . also the length was super long description says 35 which would be mid thigh for me but this thing hit me mid knee . also like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy . so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress but the shoulders def"
__label__-1 "i loved this dress . it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves . the dress has an overall relaxed fit but the sleeves were way too tight . i had to send back because of sleeves ."
__label__-1 "when i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments . it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning . after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable . i have to return it and am so disappointed . sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason ."
__label__-1 "i initially saw this top a few months ago and fell in love . it ended up selling out in stores so i ordered it online where it was back-ordered by a couple of months . i received it this past week and was sadly disappointed . the design is pretty but overall the quality is sorely lacking . i wonder if maybe the first batch was good but when they realized they were so popular and had more made the newer batches were n't as good ? not sure . the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery and ther"

__label__1 "these are my new favorite jeans . the gray wash is nice and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work . the rise is high enough that i do n't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button . and the description is true : they do n't stretch ! i 'm a loyal ag stevie shopper and the fit on these is similar ... just a little skinnier in the ankles maybe . true to size . a little long so i 'll probably hem them a couple of inches ."
__label__-1 "i 'm on the shorter ( 5 '' 3 ) side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer . this is a lovely suit but it did n't work at all for me . it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted . the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all . it was very tight and pinched . sadly i returned it ."
__label__0 "as previously mentioned this dress runs very large . i ordered accordingly and the small was the right size for my frame but it was just not flattering . i 'm pear shaped and i found the shoulders to be large the neck a bit too high and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way . i 'm 5 ' 4 140-ish and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller it could 've worked . i so wanted to love this because it 's soft and comfortable and cute but back it goes ."
__label__1 "i bought this top in 2 colors . it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear so i bought it in the 3rd color . it 's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel weekends and work . the feel of the fabric is gorgeous but it pills after wear . so when the top went on sale i bought an extra set of all 3 colors . now i have a set for play and a set for work . i love this shirt ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfect . i 'm literally wearing it right now . it 's crazy comfortable while still being flattering . it looks and feels high quality and just barely does n't hit the floor . it makes me feel like a goddess . plenty of room in the bust area even for me ( 36dd ) and does n't show bra straps or underwear . highly recommended !"
__label__-1 "i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately . it runs so large ! the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy . i do not recommend this ! it hits in all the wrong places ."
__label__1 "these jeans are pricey and worth every dollar . fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect . ladies if you have thick legs ... these jean are meant for you ."
__label__1 "i love seafolly boyleg bathing suits . i find them very flattering and just universally appealing . this one has beautiful summery design as well . i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit . i normally wear size 6 ( us size ) of this suit but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8 ( us ) which fits perfect ."
__label__-1 "the pattern is very adorable . unfortunately the design is flawed . sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide . it 's strange because i do n't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either . will return . i 'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it ."
__label__1 "this dress is wonderful . fits perfect . very comfortable . wonderful colors ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but just not a keeper for me . the top portion of the dress is fairly snug . i am normally a small in retailer sizes but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust . otherwise it was cute and simple and the tulle was quite soft . i think that i would have gone with a medium but i am wearing a small in the photo . for reference i am 5 ' 5 ~135 lbs 34c and 27 waist ."
__label__0 "i love the quality and colors of this romper ; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style . it made the bottom part pull as well . overall the fit just was n't right for me . i did love the material and it is a very nice piece ."
__label__1 "i adore this top ! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that 's been worn for years . it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round . even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders it still works and looks just fine . i 'm broad in the shoulders and we 'll endowed but the large was perfect ."
__label__0 "these are very well constructed medium weight besutiful leggings ."
__label__0 "the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty . it just made me look super wide . i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist . it just was n't going to work for my body . maybe a different size would work but i do n't like it enough to try ."
__label__-1 "this dress was not what i had hoped ! from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap . the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress . needless to say it 's going back !"
__label__1 "my favorite new dress . i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric . it 's very flattering and easy to wear ."
__label__1 "first saw this jacket in the catalog in peach and had to have it . i received it today and love it . its a soft muted peach very neutral . i ordered xl im usually a m-l but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy . the quality is great feels good on . love it so much i just ordered it in the dark grey . very classic jacket will wear for years . one of my favorite hei hei pieces never disappoints ."
__label__1 "this jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful . i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer . sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it too tight on chest and arms . i recommend going a size up . also this jacket is really cropped probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it otherwise might appear too short ."
__label__1 "i love this shimmer tank-in both colors ! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank . i think you can never go wrong with sparkles especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit . the straps on this tank are not adjustable and if you are large chested i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank . i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh"
__label__0 "i was so excited to receive this shirt . it is a beautiful color and material and very well made . i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt . however i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust . it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide . i am a 32dd 5 ' 3 and 115 pounds for reference . if you are more narrow and do n't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go"
__label__-1 "i 'm petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model . the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right . it looks great on the model here but not on me . going back . so bummed . the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders . so there is a tiny bit of detail . overall not a great sweater ."
__label__-1 "there 's just nothing special about it . it runs small and the fabric is itchy . the design with button caught my eye but i did n't like it well enough to keep it ."
__label__-1 "such a great dress . fit is flattering . the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd . classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes . thrilled with purchase !"
__label__-1 "i ordered these in both colors . the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here . these tees are very slouchy . if you wanted a more fitted look size down . these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans . the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be ( they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos ) . -- -- -- -- -- overall these are very nice . but there is one is"
__label__1 "you have to try it on to see it fits really well and looks stylish . i love it . my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy not sure if it will hold up well in the long run ."
__label__1 "this looks just like the picture . it 's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots . love it !"
__label__1 "i was n't immediately attracted to this shirt but decided to try it on . i loved it on ! it is comfortable and very flattering . i 'm a small person and the length was n't overbearing on me . it was full but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person . i 'm not sure how it works on a fuller person but my guess is it may surprise you !"
__label__1 "saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i 'd give it a try . i 'm always looking for comfortable skirts that are n't too tight around the waist . once i zipped it up i knew it would be a keeper ! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well . the material is a little heavier weight but that 's fine it can work for winter as well . it 's soft yet structured . the pockets are always a plus . if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors this is out of the box"
__label__1 "i am 5 ' 8 size 4-6 us . i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing . i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6 ) . it 's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress . maybe too much for someone more petite . it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on : )"
__label__-1 "the dress has a partially sewn-in slip which really did n't work for me . no matter how much adjusting i did i could n't get the slip and dress to sit properly . i ordered a medium and if it had n't been for the slip the fit would have been good . the length was as pictured . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd ."
__label__1 "the fabric is thin though . you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up !"
__label__0 "this top has too much fabric ! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large !"
__label__0 "i had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy . i love the lightweight material . i love the way it fits . however - all the seams are sewn quite obviously inside out . only after i received the navy shirt where it is extremely obvious did i check the mauve one . those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it was n't really noticable . i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but because i love the style and the fit i kept it ."
__label__1 "i really liked these leggings so comfy ! they are so soft and the waistband is thick ( about an inch wide ) . i am a size 10 in pants i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles . these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip ."
__label__-1 "i usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small . i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit . pretty but returning ."
__label__-1 "i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired . it fits tts length is fine ... the inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap ( kinda canvas feeling ? ) . the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way . it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm . this is definitely going back ."
__label__1 "such a festive sweater and i 've received many compliments anytime i wear it . unique and fun to wear !"
__label__1 "love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look . quality seems ok though i 'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it 's the perfect length at the moment ( i 'm 5 ' 7 and it just covers my butt ) . good sale purchase !"
__label__0 "this suit itself is adorable . i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big . it says light padding but there is no padding . just a giant empty cup . i 'm going to order the size medium ."
__label__0 "i did n't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers but this dress is incredibly long and large especially compared to the picture . for reference i 'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me particularly on the bottom half . i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this sweater . it 's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely . it 's definitely more cropped ( i 'm 5 ' 7 ) but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt . so cozy !"
__label__1 "the petite was a little bit long on me ( i 'm 5 ' 2 ) but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable breezy . covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside . a keeper !"
__label__0 "i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants . the idea is great - leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look . however i could n't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around ( ca n't bend the leg all the way ; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee ) . the fit was perfect everywhere else . sadly these had to go back : ("
__label__0 "these jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable . i ca n't recommemd them though because they 're see through . wish white jeans were better lined so that this is n't usually a problem !"
__label__0 "my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around ( not all the way ) you can see the pin in the back . that should have been a clue that this dress is n't meant to fit anyone properly if it does n't fit the model . i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long . you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr"
__label__-1 "this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt . i am very petite -- 90 pounds and 5 ' 2 . the arms fit -- length and width but nothing else about this fit . the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath . it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs . yikes ! it looks cute on the model but not on me . the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top ."
__label__0 "i loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets . the fabric was a nice weight not too thin like lots of retailer tops . i liked the top from the front however the back was way too long especially with the looseness of the style . it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted . it might work on someone taller . i 'm 5 ' 3 and 120 lbs . and i tried xs ."
__label__1 "this is a very sexy skirt . very slimming ... a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe . dress it up or down . the slits are high so you are exposed like a short shirt ."
__label__-1 "bought this shirt on-line . wanted to love it but just could n't . i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style .... just did n't have enough shape . had to send it back ."
__label__0 "i like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin . i like the handkerchief hemline too.i did n't realize how much i would not like the neckline . it feels too tight and too high to me and i 'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck . also the fit is loose maybe a bit too loose for my taste . but it 's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress ."
__label__-1 "so wanted great pair of sweater leggings ... great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple . these are not that . these fit very poorly ... i ordered the small which is more like a large one in the waistline ... there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them . unfortunately i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~"
__label__-1 "i ordered a size small ( usually i am ps ) but wanted the extra length . usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time . such a cute style but made me look short & wide . unfortunately it 's going back"
__label__1 "i love this kimono ! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame . you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement !"
__label__-1 "i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite one 00. the style color and cut are all perfect . one not so minor downfall however . the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on . i ca n't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed . very sad about this ."
__label__1 "fits great and just as pictured . the material is very smooth and slinky ."
__label__1 "i agree with the previous review i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store ( which is 2 hrs from my house ! ) . the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy . the caveat it is quite short . i am 5'10 135 lbs . i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed ."
__label__1 "cute sweater ! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath .."
__label__0 "i bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look . i 'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it . it runs small . i plan on wearing it for casual errand days ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality . the quality of the material is not very good . i 've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they 're very soft and very well made hence my disappointment . i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress ."
__label__-1 "i usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me . sadly this dress is a definite exception which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress . as other reviewers stated the dress does run small but even if you size up if you have any breasts at all the dress will pull at the buttons causing them to gape ( i 'm only a b cup so not on the large side . ) i 'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture . i love"
__label__0 "this thing sheds so much it 's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people 's couches . it 's cute and fits well other than that . buy a sticky roller !"
__label__-1 "beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on . as the other reviews state it is short and wide . i like the top so much i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape . otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box : ("
__label__1 "very cute on fits well . versatile top i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall ."
__label__0 "this is a very pretty color . loved the flow and the length of this top . however the neck hole seemed too small for the top . all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff . going back"
__label__0 "very soft material length is great a little more loose than i would have liked ."
__label__-1 "the black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful . the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color . it simply did not match . it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color . the fit was ok. just did n't love it ."
__label__-1 "very disappointed . ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i would n't have worn it and the zipper was sticking . the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked . some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $ 100 but at $ 228 they are not . returning both sizes ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater . it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe . i live in minnesota so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential . this sweater fits the bill . i love how soft and warm it is the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional ( warm and cozy ) . i love anything with pockets which this has . i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short . i did not find that to be true for me and i ordere"
__label__-1 "unfortunately this sweater let me down ! i love retailer especially their sweaters but this one fell flat . it was tight on the arms and did n't hang well on my body . it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame . i kept it because i wanted to force it to work alas i just donated it . hopefully it fits someone else better than me .."
__label__0 "if you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body . this does n't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist . it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest . also i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons as several were off some of the dresses ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to purchase this dress ; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing i love knits and i have loved other maeve dresses . however i simply can not fathom how poorly this is designed -- it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress . for reference i am 5 ' 5 slender and small-boned but also curvy ( hourglass ) . my bust is 36 c hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses . maybe it 's j"
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__1 "these pants are perfect for any casual occasion . they can be worn to run errands hang around the house or even go out with friends . i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you do n't want to wear jeans or anything tight . they are a bit pricy but i 'm very happy with how they fit ."
__label__1 "okay this is the cutest sleep jumper i 've ever owned . it 's soft and cozy and even a tiny bit sexy . i give it 4 stars because it 's a little on the thin side ; not sheer but close . really fun little piece . definitely recommend ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this suit . the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to . it does not ride up at all which almost never happens with swim suits . i 'm going to order this in a different color next season . i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments ."
__label__1 "comfy but constantly picking pills off of it from first wear ."
__label__1 "i was n't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first even after i bought it but after wearing it i am sold ! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry . i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top . the dress is super comfortable - fabric fit and length . it billows in such a pretty way when you walk ! the color also made my skin look extra tan which i loved ! the waist is short and rides up now and then"
__label__0 "i was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile . the dress is beautiful but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten . if you are single good luck trying to get it buttoned . i 'll be returning it ."

__label__-1 "do n't be fooled by the photos online . the color is a bright baby blue not pale blue . it 's a beautifully designed dress however the material is so bulky and heavy . it 's so unflattering . i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true : this dress just hung on me and pulled me down . i wanted so much to love it but i returned it ."
__label__1 "i 'm normally a small in retailer tops but i could tell that this would run big . i 'm glad i sized down to an extra small . this top is flowy and airy without being baggy . the colors are summery and beautiful . my only complaint is that it 's a bit sheer and i can see the outline of my bra in front . i will have to wear a cami underneath ."
__label__0 "love at first sight ( via the internet ) ; upon arrival i was on the fence . . the fabric is slinky and loose ; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large ( perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body ) . the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms ; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth ; otherwise when the arms are extended the sleeves do hav"
__label__1 "cute shirt it looked big so i ordered a size smaller . worked fine . would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down . ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back . fun shirt though !"
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 7 130 lbs . i ordered a medium-regular . the dress fell three inches above my knees . this model is taller than i am and it falls to her knees .... does n't make sense . i think retailer sends petites in place of regular ."
__label__-1 "looks like a pregnancy top . a lot gathers in front and back . added 10 pounds to me . not flattering on much longer than on the model . and the color is not white . it 's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe . i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks great online with boots as shown . when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms was n't too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest ( 36c ) the dress never came back in to show my feminine waist/shape . it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing ! similar to a mumu ."
__label__1 "this dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger . the material clings to all the right places and feels really good . i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on . would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable . if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it . adorable !"
__label__1 "i saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down . is perfect ! one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own . was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i 'm short and curvy but it 's very flattering . can dress up or wear to the beach . i love it ! !"
__label__-1 "every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye . there was never a large or xl to try on ; however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both . the xl was too large ; the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck . if i would have kept one it would have been the large ; however they are both going back . a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is"
__label__0 "i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom . it is too pricey to live up to my expectations . it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you ca n't see in the pictures . this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap . it is made of viscose and dry clean only . the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion . if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me ."
__label__-1 "after readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner . boy was i wrong ! first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on . i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o ' one size fits all ' sizing . it did not embrace my curves at all . the material was not as chic as i would have thought . overall the entire dress was not flattering . honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it ."
__label__0 "i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends . it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves . i could purchase the belt with it but i do n't prefer to purchase products that can not stand on their own ."
__label__0 "i bought three of these tees . i kept the turquoise one only though . the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad . i love the style . the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy . the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic ( like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me ) now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab . i normally look better in more vibrant colors . the red i bought made me look like a corpse . it 's not pretty at all . ca n't re"
__label__-1 "the shirt is very big . it would be cute as a maternity shirt ."
__label__-1 "it 's a rather boring tank . i thought it 'd be perfect under a cardigan for work but decided against it . the fit is boxy and does not look good on a girl with curves ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this set but sadly it just did n't fit as i had hoped . the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy . returned ."
__label__1 "this is the softest most perfectly cut basic . love the black wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered . as usual with retailer basics i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top but it did n't work for me at all . it shows your bra straps perfectly . plus it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier . no thanks !"

__label__1 "needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops . hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint . they fit like a glove and are true to size . i do n't think the picture does them justice . if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants . you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer . i would not hesitate to purchase them ."
__label__-1 "i had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website . however after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type . i am 5 ' 6 size 4 hourglass/athletic . the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape . would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure ."
__label__1 "i have never looked good in a legging . stretchy denim jeggings are usually the most i can get away with . but i am amazed how flattering these are ! the fit is great ( i got a m cause i 'm small but curvy in my hips/butt ) the material is thick enough not to reveal too much and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed . the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too -- i 'm pretty short but they are n't too long on me there 's a ve"

__label__0 "i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price ... but i see why . it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit ... i would have needed 6 more to even zip the top part ! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first ! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter ... never too soon to plan ahead !"

__label__-1 "normally hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses . this dress is a big thumbs down . as most of these reviewer 's and myself point out the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you do n't just get a peak of your bra you get to see the whole side of it . secondly the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra too small for the average woman . the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle"

__label__0 "wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured ! ! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory . in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory . it seems well made but very delicate . i 'm not a fan of tops ( especially pricey ones ) that require a camisole but this top is a very retailer piece so most likely i will keep it just a bit disappointed ."

__label__1 "this is a great light free flowing top for the summer . i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area but if you are small busted you wo n't be affected . it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer !"

__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend .

__label__0 "im 5 ' 1 and about 110lbs . ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all . the wool was very soft and stretchy . and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color . it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure . might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $ 100 ."
__label__1 "i had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays . first it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing . where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves ... they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily . the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags ( one in each sleeve ) that were already running a bit . to me that was a huge red flag that i should n't be spending so much money o"
__label__1 "i fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on . it does n't look nearly as good on the hanger so definitely worth trying on . the fabric is high quality and super comfy ; the fit is very flattering . i am curvy 5 ' 7 and got the navy stripe print in size small . it 's very forgiving fitted without clinging to any problem areas . i also love how versatile it is -- you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings . love it !"
__label__0 "this is the perfect peplum . it floats a bit but does n't stick out and is super flattering . that 's why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off and the peplum pleat is crooked . geeze retailer . this is why i ca n't justify buying much of anything unless it 's on sale . quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill ."
__label__0 "i loved this top when i saw it online . i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly it is not the top for me . if you have a large chest then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance . the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly . if i were an a or b this probably would have worked . i should have known to stay away from a pleated top ."

__label__0 "this is a beautiful top however it looks better on the 80 pound model . the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body . if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are ."
__label__0 "not good for for an hourglass shape . lots and lots of pretty fabric but the waist hits just where the hips widen -- very bohemian ( just no good for a figure 8 ) . the sizing is generous . with both elastic and a zipper there 's room to go small if between sizes be aware : the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic . i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out . would perhaps work on a very narrow person who 's completel"
__label__-1 "for reference i am 5 ' 5 ' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly . the problems : 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple . 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt . in other words i had a very pointy butt . also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir"

__label__0 "this is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house . i 'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it 's a bit scratchy around the edges . i was going to buy another color if i loved this but as it is i will keep the one"

__label__0 "i love the style and color of this jumpsuit . i ordered a petite and with tall shoes it 's still about 3 too long . the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it so that 's a pain in the rear . also this has a side zipper but you step through the neckline to put it on . if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger this would never work . the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot . there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust . i 'm hoping to be"
__label__0 "i tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent . a little big is better than something way to small . well that was a mistake with this top . i sized up and it was much too large everywhere more so than i thought it would be . but the neck there 's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head ! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on . cute top material is so-so ."

__label__-1 "this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and ca n't be saved . the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just does n't lay right underneath . the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse . i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print . definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25- % ."

__label__-1 "i really love the idea behind this . however the fit does n't work for me . i 'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops . this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width . the neckline was very high ( higher than it looks in the model photo ) and the armholes were too big . so i do n't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue . the other criticism is that the front is not lined ."

__label__0 "overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots did n't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad ! ! ! )"
__label__0 "the colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable . i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd . the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts ( or if you do n't mind some cleavage showing ) . this length was also a bit too long so if you are 5 ' 5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size ."
__label__1 "this top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers . so many nice details and a great fit !"
__label__1 "i 've only worn the sweater a handful of times but i 'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is . it 's a bit on the baggier side but that does n't stop it from looking great . i 've gotten complements on it every time i 've worn it . i would highly recommend it to people who do n't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles ."
__label__-1 "this sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off . it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it . it was uneven and stretched out . it looked like it was not well made to me . it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz . i returned this one ."
__label__0 "the sweater is very very warm . it looks okay not the best but not bad . i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i do n't wear sweaters and jackets without closures . i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder . so i am sending it back ."
__label__1 "the pattern is cute and vibrant and the shillouette is simple but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me ( 36dd ) ."
__label__-1 "i think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type just not mine . i 'm 5 ' 5 125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum . thought this could be a good shirt while i 'm nursing bc it 's flowy but stylish . unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on . the cut drew all attention to my big chest -- -not in a good way -- and distracted from my smaller lower half . made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am . probably good for small chested girls very tall girls or curvy on the"
__label__1 "this top is comfort wear or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work . because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer . that said it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it . i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"
__label__1 "love these pants they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all . so beware if you are curvy you might want to size up . great quality and style overall ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater ! it 's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length . i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long like i had hoped . the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo but i actually like that even better ."
__label__0 "great colors and not too voluminous . lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it 'll require a belt or something over it ( looks v casual alone ) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it 's a huge piece of elastic . i 've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it . lol but it 's not worth it at the current price ."
