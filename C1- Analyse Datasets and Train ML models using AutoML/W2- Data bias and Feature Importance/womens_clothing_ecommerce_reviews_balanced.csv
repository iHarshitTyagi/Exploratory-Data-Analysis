-1,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,Blouses
-1,The first time i wore it  felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad,Blouses
-1,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,Blouses
-1,The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.,Blouses
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,Blouses
-1,This top is really cute and i love the design. however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling.,Blouses

-1,I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.,Blouses
-1,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,Blouses
0,"I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down  the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6"" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra",Blouses

0,I really wanted to like this shirt  but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all.,Blouses
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret,Blouses
0,Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.,Blouses
0,I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10  even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa,Blouses
0,I love a good peplum top  and was so excited when it arrived  but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering  because in every other way  it fit like a dream  but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.,Blouses
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering",Blouses
0,Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing  but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.,Blouses
1,This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,Blouses
1,This is a great  casual top that can work in all seasons. i love it with skinny pants/jeans.,Blouses
1,I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.,Blouses
1,"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",Blouses
1,Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple  very wearable with pants  with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest  without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes  it is cropped...very much so!!! so  if,Blouses
1,This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed  so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days  but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!,Blouses
1,"I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1""  115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!",Blouses
1,This is a quirky  whimsical  uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is  a fun  conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts  very comfy  yes boxy  but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties  or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.,Blouses
1,I wish there were be fewer asymmetrical tops in the store. i see many tops i like until i discover they have an asymmetrical hem and are longer in the back  which i do not prefer.,Blouses
-1,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.,Dresses
-1,"The title says it all. while the quality was good  when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5"")  which was ok  but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs  which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!",Dresses
-1,This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.,Dresses
-1,"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding",Dresses
-1,Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!,Dresses
-1,So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!,Dresses
-1,Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs  and 4 was the smallest size available  so i ordered it. when i opened it  it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.,Dresses
-1,This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.,Dresses
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!,Dresses
0,The material is soft and the pattern is pretty  but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting  with some stretch and a zipper  because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall  very slender ladies  this will be pretty  as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top)  but it went right back into the bag without a thought.,Dresses
0,I love  love  love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone  and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid  and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back  so you cannot put it on yourself  unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.,Dresses
0,"Beautifully made  gorgeous colors. i wanted to love this  but it just wasn't flattering - too ""a"" shaped  not enough drape to flatter.",Dresses
0,The dress is nice  but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit. i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.,Dresses
0,This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.,Dresses
0,This dress is beautiful  made with high-quality fabric  unique design and color  etc.  but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal  but i just couldn't make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on  the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long  and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall  s,Dresses
0,I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it  so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because  yes  this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.    the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long  you end up clingi,Dresses
0,If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also  i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons  as several were off some of the dresses.,Dresses
0,"The cotton  the print  and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful  i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model  and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else  it's nearly empire on me. and  there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig",Dresses

1,"This dress is a lovely creation! however  i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4""  weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!    otherwise  this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk  it would be un",Dresses
1,I originally eyed this dress online - the lovely and comfortable weight of it can only be appreciated in person  however. it's a dress i'd be able to wear for hours on end.,Dresses
1,I loved the styling of this dress the first time i saw it. i ordered it and i slipped it on and wow! it is super comfortable. the darts at the waist add shape and interest. the shape highlights the waist. the fabric is cozy without being weighty. i did find it ran large and wish there was an xxs available. my husband loved it and he doesn't like anything! it is likely that the reviewers who think that t looked like a nightgown may have needed a smaller size. i think this one is a diamond in the,Dresses
1,I received this dress yesterday and it exceeded expectations! i was not expecting the fabric to have a slight stretch and felt that the fabrication aided to the overall comfort of the dress without losing any of the quirky elegance. due to the stretch  however  i immediately ordered a size down for comparison. i'm a pretty solid 2 with eva franco dresses but with this cut i had about an inch of fabric in the waist. regardless  i'm keeping the dress - jury is just still out on which side!! measur,Dresses
1,Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,Dresses

1,First i definitely understand why most reviewers either adore or hate this dress. luckily for me it worked in my favor although i will point out the downsides too. (1) it runs small. the only reason i was able to fit my usual size is because i have a tiny bust and have been working to tone up. but still i had to maneuver to get the sidezip up. i would size up but....(2) being that this dress runs small it appears more fitted on top as if it were a fit and flare or bustier which i like.

-1,I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.,Fine gauge
-1,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9""  so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect. i loved the",Fine gauge

0,Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap  like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.,Fine gauge
0,Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment  i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately  this one's going back.,Fine gauge

0,"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2""  115lbs  32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it  o well.",Fine gauge

0,Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size  but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.,Fine gauge
0,This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very  very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.,Fine gauge
1,I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things  then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try.,Fine gauge

0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates

1,This is so beautiful! i loved it online  but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!,Intimates
1,This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body  but does not squeeze. it is super soft  smooth  and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!,Intimates
1,The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality  then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit  i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!,Intimates
1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates
1,This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.,Intimates
1,Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker  i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences  and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty  and this one fits  it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind  the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie ,Intimates
1,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.,Intimates
-1,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.,Jackets
-1,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website  it's more like 18"")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",Jackets

-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,Jackets

-1,I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts  length is fine...the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.,Jackets
-1,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.,Jackets
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.,Jackets
-1,I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning,Jackets
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets

0,This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large  i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!,Jackets
0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets
0,"Tried the navy in store. boy does it run big! i'm normally a size 6 / small (ish). 5'6""  34a-28-36. the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted. i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves. it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap - sorry!",Jackets
1,I bought this to wear in the warm climates  when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car  it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much  going to by another one similar and have on again!,Jackets
1,"I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors. i'm 5'7""  120 pounds and bought the size 4 which is perfect. initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the 6 because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders. the 6 was too boxy on me and i'm so glad i went with the 4. it stretched  especially the arms  and fits perfect. i love how i can dress this down (with a graphic tee and jeans) or dress up (with a blouse and cropped black pants).",Jackets
1,"Absolutely love this jacket - soft  nice amount of stretch  and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!",Jackets
1,120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me  i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.,Jackets
1,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!,Jackets
1,But tight around the chest  i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area  kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic  and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.,Jackets
1,First of all i love retailer  i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.,Jackets
1,Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.,Jackets
1,"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled",Jackets
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,Jeans
-1,They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p,Jeans

-1,"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",Jeans

-1,Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise  you might like them. i can't comment on fit..,Jeans
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans

0,I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc,Jeans

0,I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are,Jeans

0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming  and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned  and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also  it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!,Layering

0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,Legwear

1,I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if,Sleep
1,Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!,Sleep
1,I absolutely love slips  and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans  i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses  and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough,Sleep

1,So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft  and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5'5   125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won't regret. also   finally - perfect length .,Sleep
1,I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!,Sleep
1,I cannot say enough about these pajama pants. they're beautiful and crazy comfortable. it's a nice change from black or grey. i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me. i wanted a petite l because i am short  but the regular large is fine. i just wear them higher up on my hips. i normally wait for sales on sleepwear  but i couldn't resist on these. they're well worth the investment!,Sleep
1,Retailer sleep pants are my favorite...the only sleep pants i will wear. fit is perfect. flowing shape and ultra-soft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury. first thing i put on when i get home from work!,Sleep
-1,I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.,Sweaters

-1,Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.,Sweaters
-1,I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.,Sweaters
-1,"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9""  it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.  also  it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.  too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking.",Sweaters

-1,When i saw this item online  i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it. the pros: very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo  the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had,Sweaters
-1,I ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess  is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin  itchy  doesn&#39;t drape very well  and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.,Sweaters
0,"I'm a vest lover of all shapes  lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end  the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest  drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose  i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8"" 140#.  overall i sent it back.",Sweaters
0,"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately  the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so  it will be returned.",Sweaters
0,This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi,Sweaters
0,The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought,Sweaters
0,My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great  but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath  but don't even think about wearing it by itself!,Sweaters
0,It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.,Sweaters
0,This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.,Sweaters
0,I was really excited for this sweater  its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.,Sweaters
0,The sweater is cute  but scratchy.,Sweaters
1,Perfect spring transition piece-- saffron yellow but medium weight and breathable. this color is in for spring and the perfect blend for a not too warm cover up!,Sweaters
1,This sweater is really pretty in person  and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale  and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter  but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it.,Sweaters
1,Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.,Sweaters
1,"I just got this in the green and i'd say the color is deeper/darker than shown. more of a turquoise-green  or muted teal color. it's the densest  thickest cashmere (it's 100% cashmere) i've felt in a while and it's so soft. but  it just doesn't look good on me. i'm 5'3"" and about 105 lbs  and usually wear xspetite. i got this in the xs regular hoping it would be long enough for leggings. and i don't think it is in the back. plus it's just too bell shaped and i'm slightly pear-shaped already. it",Sweaters
1,Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky  which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.,Sweaters
1,I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything. as another reviewer noted  some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart. not something acceptable at this price point.  unlike her  this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily  for weeks and feel like the buttons  trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft  warm and cl,Sweaters
1,Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,Sweaters
1,"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser  relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories.",Sweaters
1,Love the style of this vest  and an added bonus is how soft it is. every vest is different  though  so if you're shopping in the store  be sure to look at all of them.,Sweaters
-1,The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.,Swim
-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Swim
-1,I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,Swim
-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,Swim
-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
-1,This product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.,Swim
-1,"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it.",Swim

-1,"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately  the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.",Swim
0,I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,Swim
0,"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute  however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also  for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back.",Swim
0,Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.,Swim
0,I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.    the birds of paradise are just lovely  not exactly the same on every suit  but still nice. i just,Swim

0,This is a beautiful suit. was looking for a one piece. i ordered online. it is definitely high quality  but i ended up returning it. the colors seemed much more muted than the picture shows. i loved the fit  just wasn't as striking as i expected.,Swim
1,Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium  when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose  so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one  but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.,Swim
1,Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind  and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings  so that may be uncomfortable for some  but i found no problem with it. for reference  i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants  and i purchased a medium.,Swim
1,These bottoms run very small! i'm 5ft 3in and 100 pounds with a 25 inch waist and both the xsmall and small were too small. i think i'll need a size medium.,Swim
1,I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don't like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying  i liked the suit enough to keep it.,Swim
1,I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit  the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest  which i do (32g)  this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit  though i would go a size up if you have a lar,Swim

-1,I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.,Trend

-1,I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.     it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.,Trend
-1,"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb  5'-4""  36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol. also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online.",Trend

0,The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so doesn't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. haven't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy  cool professor vibe that i like.,Trend

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
0,It is polyester but seems good quality. looks like a girls nightgown with the pattern combined with the baby doll dress silhouette and the overall width of the dress. i usually wear a small but  to look like it does on the model  6-8 inches would have to go in the width.,Trend
0,I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.,Trend
0,This runs small  i got the size 3 which fits like a medium  not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit  it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.,Trend
0,I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine  but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different  but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.,Trend
0,This gorgeous &amp;amp;amp; beautiful dress is hampered by a see-through unlined bodice and all viscose/polyester fabrication.  by the way  did you see the price tag?  at least the skirt is lined.  if you have deep pockets and don't mind the slightly rough fabric  go for it.  and wear a nice bra.  size up if you're busty.,Trend

1,Besides being my favorite color to wear  this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to  because it fits in a 1940s type of way  and when i took it to my tailor  she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces  but is perfect for a night out.,Trend
